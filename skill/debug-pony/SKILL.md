description: Debug a failure as a ledger, not a guess — read what already broke here, get a repro, narrow the fail path, kill hypotheses before testing them, and close the fix with cause, what was ruled out, and the guard, so the next session starts where this one ended. Trigger on /debug-pony and proactively whenever debugging starts — a bug report, something broken/throwing/failing/flaky, a request to debug/diagnose/investigate, or a pasted stack trace or error log.

# Debug Pony — a debug session the next agent can stand on

A debug session produces two things: a fix, and a list of what was ruled out on the way. The
fix lands in git. The ruled-out list dies with the transcript unless you write it down — and it
is the part the next agent at this file needs most. This skill is the four passes below, in
order, with fael at both ends.

## Pass 0 — Read what broke here before

Before a repro, before a hypothesis:

```bash
fael find --files <suspected files> [<symptom words>]
fael find --files <suspected files> --all --kind issue    # closed ones carry cause → fix → tried
```

An open issue on the symptom is this bug — `fael claim <id>` and work it, don't file a second.
A closed one is a breadcrumb from an earlier session: its *tried* list is runs you don't repeat,
its guard is a test that should already be failing (if it isn't, that is evidence too). No fael
in this session (no tool, no `fael` on PATH) → skip this pass and the record at the end; never
install it uninvited.

## Pass 1 — A repro you can rerun

No hypothesis before a repro. The target is a fast, deterministic pass/fail: a failing test, a
script, a CLI line — pinned time, seeded RNG, no network, its own temp dir.

- Fails every time → write the steps down as that runnable thing.
- Fails sometimes → not debuggable yet. Raise the rate (loop it, stress it, widen the timing
  window) until it fails often enough to tell a fix from luck.
- Can't make it fail → stop and say so. Ask for the env, the logs, the artifact, or leave to
  instrument. Guessing from here is how a phantom gets "fixed".

## Pass 2 — Narrow the fail path

Find where reality leaves your model. Cheapest tool first, escalate only when it can't reach:

1. A debugger at the failing site, if the env has one.
2. Read the path end to end and list every input that can change the outcome — flags, env,
   config, input shape, timing, build options. Flip one at a time against the repro.
3. Probes in the code. Tag each with one unique prefix (`[DBG-xxxx]`) so removing them is one
   grep — and remove them before the fix is called done.

## Pass 3 — Try to kill each hypothesis first

Hold 2–4 candidate causes, not one. For each: does it explain the whole symptom, start to end?
What single run would prove it wrong? Run that run first. A cause that survives its own
disproof is worth fixing; one that dies just saved you a wrong fix.

## Pass 4 — Keep the ledger

Every run gets one line: what changed → what happened → what it ruled in or out. When a new
cause comes up, check it against every line, not just the last one — one contradicting run
means it is wrong or incomplete. Stuck between causes? Design the one run whose result decides
it, and run that instead of another near-duplicate.

The ruled-out lines are the *tried* part of the record below. Keep them short and concrete.

## At the fix — close it where it happened

The fix is done when the repro passes, a guard exists (the repro, kept as a test), and the
probes are gone. Run the guard once against the code before the fix: it must fail there — a
guard that passes either way guards nothing. Then, once, in the same message as your next tool call:

```bash
# an issue already open on it (from Pass 0, or filed mid-session):
fael close <id> "<cause> → <fix>; tried <ruled-out 1>, <ruled-out 2>; guard `<test path>`"

# none open — file it under a key, then close by that key (no id to copy):
fael add issue "<symptom, standalone>" --files <files the fix touched> --key <k>
fael close --key <k> "<cause> → <fix>; tried …; guard `<test path>`"
```

The close line's shape is fael's, not this skill's — the fael skill is its source; follow it
if the two ever differ.

- `<id>` only from this session's `fael find` output — never from memory.
- No guard possible (env-only, can't be tested)? Say why in place of the guard. A close
  without one is the row most likely to repeat.
- Given up, not fixed → don't close. `fael add note` the ledger (what was ruled out, where the
  fail path stopped narrowing) on the same files, so the next session starts from there.
- `add` or `close` errors → say so in one line and move on. Never redo the debug because
  storage failed.

## Rules

- **Order is the skill.** No fix before a repro, no hypothesis before the fail path is narrowed,
  no "found it" before the disproof ran and the ledger agrees.
- **Fael reads, you judge.** A past row is a lead, never a verdict — verify it against the repro
  like any other breadcrumb.
- **Report in lines.** Repro, cause, fix, guard, the fael id. The ledger lives in the record,
  not in a closing essay.
