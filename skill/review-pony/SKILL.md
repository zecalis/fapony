description: Review a plan, PR, diff, or design doc as a verification rather than an opinion — scope first, walk the real path, break it on paper, cite everything. Takes optional effort (low|medium|high|max, widens the walk only, never skips a pass) and --fix (apply CONFIRMED blocker/major findings after the report). Records surviving findings to fael after the report. Trigger on /review-pony and proactively whenever the user asks to review, audit, scrutinize, sanity-check, or get a second opinion on a plan, PR, diff, design doc, or proposed code change.

# Review Pony

**A review is a verification, not an opinion.** Anything you cannot trace, run, or cite is
something you feel about the code — and feelings are what make reviews long and useless.

Four passes. Run them in order. Each one is allowed to end the review early.

**Args:** `effort` (`low|medium|high|max`, default `medium`) — widens or narrows pass 2's walk
only. Passes 1, 3, and 4 run in full at every level; effort never skips verification, it only
changes how far you walk before writing findings down. There is no `ultra` here — that's
multi-agent cloud review; point the user at `/code-review ultra` instead.
`--fix` — after the report, apply every `blocker`/`major` `CONFIRMED` fix (never nits, never
`PLAUSIBLE`) — details in the `--fix` section below. `--comment` is not supported — PR-posting
is another tool's job.

## The four passes

1. **Scope is a finding.** Does this need to exist, and does it need to be this big?
2. **Claims are not facts.** Walk the real path. Run what can be run.
3. **A finding needs a failing input.** Cannot write one? Not a finding.
4. **Facts carry a citation.** `file:line`, output, or trace step — or it doesn't ship.

Carry them. Do not post them, and do not narrate them — the reader wants what you found, not
proof that you looked. Start at pass 1.

---

## Before: scope facts (fapony, optional)

Run `fapony review-seed` with the scope flag matching what you're reviewing (default = uncommitted,
`--commit <sha>`, `--range <a...b>`, `--files f1,f2,dir`, `--plan <PLAN.md>`). The output is where to
enter, never coverage — walk it, run it, kill your findings as normal. No fapony CLI or the call
errors → skip silently and review anyway — a hint, not a gate. Mid-walk, `--files <f> --body <sym>[,<sym>]
--callers <sym>[,<sym>]` answers "what does this do / who calls it" without reading the file.

**`--plan` on an already-shipped plan comes back "nothing in this scope" — that's the wrong scope,
not no scope.** A shipped plan has nothing left in the working tree to diff. If its header cites
commit shas (`> Status: shipped ... Commits: <sha1> ... <shaN>`), re-run against those — one
`--range <first-sha>^...<last-sha>` covering them, or `--commit <sha>` per commit — and walk that
instead. Only treat the plan as prose-only, no code to walk, when its header cites no commits.

## Pass 1 — Scope is a finding

Say what the change is for in one sentence, in your own words. If you can't, the artifact is
underspecified. That is the review. Report it and stop.

Then take one pass down the ladder, and stop at the first rung that reaches the same goal:

1. **Nothing.** Is the problem load-bearing, or is this a fix for a hypothetical?
2. **What's already here.** A function, a flag, a stdlib call the author didn't know about.
3. **A native mechanism.** A DB constraint over app logic, config over code, build over runtime.
4. **90% for 10%.** The narrow change that solves the real case and drops the exotic ones.

If a rung holds, name it **before** any line-by-line notes. A scope finding is worth more than
every other finding combined, and it is worth nothing once the author has already rewritten the
code to answer your nits.

Mandatory even on small changes. Skip only if the user says "don't question scope".

## Pass 2 — Claims are not facts

The diff is where you enter, not what you review.

- **Walk the path end-to-end**: entry point → call sites → branches taken → state mutated → exit
  or side effect. Read the *unchanged* code on both sides. A diff is correct in isolation far
  more often than it is correct in place.
- **Read who calls this.** A signature change is fine until the third caller passes the old shape.
- **Run what can be run.** Reading cannot see a command that exits 0 without doing anything, a
  timeout budget no real suite fits, or a server still serving last week's build. A green result
  you produced outranks a green result you inferred, every time.
- **For a plan or design doc**, walk the proposed flow against the system that exists — where
  does it touch reality, and what does it assume that isn't true today?

Write down every place the walk surprises you. Surprises outrank style; chase them first.

**Effort controls how far this walk goes, nothing else:**

- `low` — direct callers only, one hop. No test reading unless the diff touches a test file.
- `medium` (default) — as written above: full path, callers, tests on the path.
- `high` — also second-degree callers, and read the tests that exercise them, not just the path.
- `max` — also grep every changed file for second-degree callers, and re-open
  every `deferred` line from the last review of this scope.

At every level, run `fael find --files <a,b,…>` (scope paths, comma-joined) once before walking (when fael is in this
session): a decision row is a choice already made — it is context, not a bug to report.

Whatever level stopped you, say so in the one-line coverage note (see Report) — "walked to 1 hop"
is honest, "walked" alone at `low` is not.

## Pass 3 — A finding needs a failing input

Before a finding reaches the report, try to kill it yourself.

- **Write the failure scenario**: concrete inputs or state → the wrong output, crash, or
  corruption. Can't write that sentence? You have a preference. Drop it.
- **Look again for the guard you missed.** This is where most findings deserve to die: the
  validation lives in the caller, the branch is unreachable, the type already excludes it.
- **Label what survives.** `CONFIRMED` — you traced or ran it. `PLAUSIBLE` — the mechanism is
  real but you could not reach the failing state. Never let the second wear the first's clothes.
- **Don't flag by pattern.** "Should use dependency injection" is taste. "Calls `fetch` in a loop
  whose length comes from user input" is a finding.

## Pass 4 — Facts carry a citation

Every claim points at a `file:line`, a command's output, or the step in the walk that exposed it.
No citation, no report line.

Keep the claim and the verification in separate sentences. "The PR says it retries twice" and
"I traced it to `client.ts:88` and the retry is unreachable" are different statements; merging
them is how a review launders an assumption into a fact.

---

## Report

The reader has the diff and is deciding what to do next. Nothing else belongs here.

**Verdict first, then at most 10 findings, at most 4 lines each, then one deferred line.**
Severity order: blocker → major → nit, and cut the nits entirely when anything structural
survived — they dilute the only thing worth reading.

**A capped report must not read as a complete one.** When more findings survived pass 3 than
the cap allows, the report ends with one line naming how many were held back and the worst
severity among them (`+ 4 more (major) — ask`) — never a silent stop at 10. A reader who
cannot tell "that's all" from "that's the cap" has been told a lie by omission.

```
<ship | fix-then-ship | rework | reject> — the single biggest reason, one sentence.

1. <blocker|major|nit> <CONFIRMED|PLAUSIBLE> — what breaks, one line
   <file:line> — the mechanism, one line
   repro: <input or state> ⇒ <wrong result vs. right one>
   fix: <the minimal change>

deferred: <thing> (<where it was specified>) · <thing>
+ <N> more (<worst severity>)   ← required only when findings exceeded the cap
```

Four lines is a ceiling, not a quota — a finding that fits in two ships in two. Drop `repro:`
only when the finding is the absence of something (no test, no guard); never drop the citation.

**Cut on sight:** the four passes as headings or prose · what you walked, ran, or ruled out ·
anything restating the diff, the plan, or the author's reasoning · a nit riding along under a
blocker · hedging that does not change the verdict.

Finding nothing is a valid result. Then the whole report is the verdict line plus one line
naming what you walked, so the reader can judge the coverage — not a tour of it.

## --fix (optional)

Only with the `--fix` arg, only after the report is shown. For each `blocker`/`major` finding
labeled `CONFIRMED`: apply the `fix:` line to the working tree. Skip every nit and every
`PLAUSIBLE` — a fix you weren't sure was a bug is a bug you're introducing on purpose.

Report what happened in one line per finding, no more:

```
fixed: 1, 2 · skipped: 3 (PLAUSIBLE — could not reach the failing state)
```

Fixing changes what actually shipped, not what the review found — re-run pass 4's citation
check on the new state before calling it done, but don't re-run the whole review.

Each finding you fix is still recorded in fael, once — what broke and how it was fixed is what
the next agent on those files needs. Before applying it, `fael add issue "<finding title>"
--files <a,b,…>` (walked paths, comma-joined) and keep the id; after, `fael close <id> "<cause> → <fix>; guard <test>"`
(the cause and fix, not the finding again); cite `(fael:<id>)` in the commit message. One closed
row per finding, and the hook's uncited-`fix:` nudge stays quiet. No fael in this session = skip.

## After: record what the next session needs (fael)

If a blocker/major CONFIRMED finding survived (`--fix` did not already record and close it), or the verdict is rework/reject,
call fael's `add` tool once (or `fael add` in the shell), after the report is shown. Don't block the report on it,
and don't let it change the report's content. Clean reviews (ship, nit-only
findings) record nothing — there is nothing the next session needs to find.

kind is `issue` when a finding survived (something is broken), `decision` when
the verdict turns on scope alone (rework/reject from pass 1 — the review locks
a direction). text is the report's verdict line, standalone — what broke or was
decided, not that a review happened. files are the repo-relative paths actually
walked — required, a row without them is unfindable. No fael in this session
(no tool, no `fael` on PATH) = skip the record, never install it uninvited.
If `add` errors, say so in one line and move on — never re-run a review
because storage failed. Whoever fixes a recorded issue later closes it by its id —
`fael close <id> "fixed in <sha>"` — never a second row retelling the finding.

---

## Rules

The four passes are the rules. These three are what they fail on in practice:

- **Order is not optional.** No line-by-line notes before pass 1, no finding before passes 2-3
  earned it, nothing stated as fact that pass 4 cannot cite.
- **The budget is binding.** Verdict, ≤10 findings, ≤4 lines each, one deferred line. Over budget
  means you are reporting process. "LGTM" is not an output either — finding nothing ships as the
  verdict line plus one line naming what you walked. When the cap bites, say how much it bit:
  a `+ N more (<severity>)` line is required — a silent stop at 10 is the same lie as a silent
  stop at 3.
- **Forget who wrote it.** The author's reasoning is context, never evidence.

## Example

```
1-4.  scope holds; walked the new gate branch; ran the evidence command — it exits 0
      without running the suite (CONFIRMED: `bun test` with no test dir exits 0)
post. add(kind="issue",
        text="incremental scan replaces cached history with a delta — cache holds 500, truth 1500",
        files=["cache.ts", "claude-code.ts"])
```

A report in budget — same review that, narrated, ran five paragraphs:

```
rework — Finding 1 corrupts the ledger this feature exists to keep.

1. blocker CONFIRMED — incremental scan replaces cached history with a delta
   cache.ts:81 overwrites by client; claude-code.ts:191 returns only new lines
   repro: line(1000 tok) → scan → +line(500) → scan ⇒ cache 500, truth 1500
   fix: merge per session_id (plan §5), or drop incremental and always full-scan

2. major CONFIRMED — usage-scan crashes on a machine with no state dir (day 1)
   cache.ts:68 writes the tmp file; writeCache never mkdirs, store.ts does
   repro: FAPONY_STATE_DIR=/tmp/nonexistent bun fapony.ts usage-scan ⇒ ENOENT
   fix: mkdirSync(faponyDir(config), { recursive: true }) before the write

3. major CONFIRMED — SQLite `since` compares seconds to ms, so it never filters
   helpers.ts:46 — max(time_created)=1789144099203 vs now_s=1789145895
   repro: opencode all-time 1494 sessions == cached 1494; the filter cannot bite
   fix: pass since*1000 — but only after 1, or these two clients corrupt too

deferred: bytes_by_tool (plan step 7) · per-client watermark (plan §6.3)
```
